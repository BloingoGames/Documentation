# Bloingo Games Business Plan

![image.png](Appendix/image.png)

# **1. Product**

## **1.1 Mission Statement & Introduction**

**Just Snap** is an innovative new game that combines the strategic, tactical nature of card games with the satisfying, challenging beats of rhythm games, enhanced with a thrilling multiplayer experience and popular ‘roguelike’ mechanics.

card 

deckbuilder

This is the first game being designed and developed by **Bloingo Games,** our new game studio striving to create groundbreaking games that both capitalise on market trends by bringing new innovations to the gaming industry.

## **1.2 The Problem**

Card games are loved by many, with countless examples of similar team sizes to our own celebrating great success in recent years ([New York Times, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-card-games/)). However lots of tabletop games are inherently flawed. Gaming connoisseurs know that tabletop games can become tedious and repetitive after a while, due to lacking rewards and incentives to keep them wanting more ([There Will Be Games, 2023](https://therewillbe.games/articles-essays/9209-repetitive-variety-a-game-doesn-t-have-to-be-different-every-time)). 

Rhythm games, on the other hand, do provide more stimulation and satisfaction: providing physical, emotional and cognitive benefits to the players that play them [(Acer, 2024)](https://blog.acer.com/en/discussion/1413/rhythm-games-their-physical-social-and-emotional-benefits#:~:text=Studies%20show%20playing%20rhythm%2Dbased,from%20enhanced%20musical%20perception%20skills). These have their own issues though, generating only niche appeal and lacking more intricate, strategic elements that keep players engaged over long periods ([Kutovaya Elena, 2023)](http://linkedin.com/pulse/how-lack-strategy-game-design-kills-games-kutovaya-elena-spfbf).

In our market analysis, we found that customers had more nuanced, specific ‘pain points’ with each of these genres that our product**,[mention when in our minutes we found this?] Just Snap**, aims to solve:

### **Traditional Card Games**

- **Repetitive Play & Reliance on Luck:** Familiar card games can grow stale, and random draws can make a player’s hard-earned skills or carefully planned strategies feel wasted. Players lose interest in a game when, after twenty rounds, they lose their carefully thought-out deck of cards to an ‘unlucky’ hand.
- **Lack of Real-Time Excitement:** The core gameplay loop remains unchanged round after round, and these games tend to demand less immediate engagement from the player.

### **Deckbuilders**

- **Option Paralysis:** While the complexity of deck configuration lends itself nicely to replayability, overwhelming choice can cause new players to become confused about which cards to add to their deck.

### **Rhythm Games**

- **One-Dimensional Progression & Niche Appeal:** Most rely on difficulty scaling for longer-term progression without adding deeper replay value.
- **High Entry Barrier:** Rapidly increasing challenge levels can alienate casual players more in interested in having fun than testing their limits.
- **Lack of variety**: There have been a few unique and successful rhythm games (eg. Guitar Hero and Geometry Dash), but most still rely solely on a basic beat-matching mechanic, with few taking advantage of more complex ideas in this space.

Just Snap overcomes these challenges by combining the strategic, but easy to pick up nature of card games with the complex, high difficulty ceilings of rhythm games. Our concept ensures an addictive and engaging gameplay loop that satisfies casual and seasoned gamers alike, creating a dynamic challenge for both music lovers and button-mashers.

## **1.3 Our Solution “Just Snap”**

Just Snap is a multiplayer card-rhythm game where players can build powerful decks of cards containing special abilities. Loosely based on the traditional card game ‘snap’, it is easy to learn, but challenging to master with its complex combinations of cards and precise musically-timed moves.

With a competitive, high-stakes multiplayer format akin to the likes of *Uno* and *War*, players win by collecting all of the cards in play. To do so, they must match their cards with other players’ in rhythm-based battles to secure their opponents’ hands: all synchronised to bespoke soundtracks designed specifically for the game.

Players can also collect special Bloingo cards that significantly alter the game. Some effects include; reversing the music, changing the tempo, or even stealing other players’ cards. These unpredictable effects raise the stakes and help level competition between newcomers and experienced players.

![image.png](Appendix/image%201.png)

These unique cards mean every play-through is different: similar to contemporary rogue-likes like *Slay the Spire* and *Hades*, limitless combinations (‘builds’) of cards can be devised to create endless possibilities.

### Addressing the Pain Points

The simplicity of *Snap* opens up possibilities for unique gameplay mechanics (REFERENCE) that these **Bloingo** cards will activate, in turn solving the issue of  “not having enough strategy” by allowing players to plan ahead based on the abilities of their held cards. 

“Option paralysis” will be avoided by having a smaller pool of special cards, ensuring that each has a specific, designed purpose and our players are never confused about what a card does; while the issues of “high difficulty” and “lack of variety” in rhythm games are inherently solved by our core concept: an engaging, accessible multiplayer card game set to a great soundtrack.

### **Competitive Advantages**

- **First-mover Advantage**: Currently, no games exist that combine these two genres. The introduction of rhythm concepts into a card game is our unique selling point.
- **Experienced Developers:** Comprising three BCSS game-jam winners and two professional musicians, the team is well equipped to produce a competitive, high quality product within this niche.
- **Cross-Platform Strategy**: We intended to develop the game for the PC market, but with mobile development also in mind: opening access to a completely new market, as soon as possible.
- **Scope:** As our first game, we have focused on a simple yet innovative, easy-to-develop concept that will ensure a fast release and allow us to promptly start working on our next innovation, adding to our flexibility in a fast-moving market.

# **2. Market**

As of Q1 2025, the global video game industry is worth **£180B**[¹](https://www.investopedia.com/global-video-game-market-could-double-in-10-years-report-says-8712136), with indie games seeing exponential growth, having a market value of **£4B** [²](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indie-game-market)

## **2.1 Video Game Customer Segmentation**

The global gaming market is currently valued at $282 billion and projected to reach [$363 billion by 2027](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-gamers#how-many-gamers-are-there-editors-picks). The UK stands out within this sector, having the largest video gaming audience in Europe [], where gaming is now a mainstream entertainment option [across diverse demographics](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/448421/gamers-in-european-countries). Over half of the UK population currently plays video games, [with 63% engaging in online gaming](https://www.statista.com/statistics/301331/online-gaming-in-the-uk/). 

The number of video game users in the UK is projected to increase from 37.7 million in 2024 to approximately 59 million [by 2029](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1402973/video-gamers-in-uk), supported by one of the highest video game user penetration rates globally at 58% - expected to rise to 70% by 2027, making it the market with the highest [proportion of gamers to overall population](https://www.statista.com/topics/8281/video-gamer-demographics-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/) worldwide.

**UK Adults between 30-39** 

Representing nearly 30% of the gaming market, with balanced gender distribution (53% male versus 47% female) and higher median income allowing for some leeway in setting our initial price point.

**18-24 year old online multiplayer players**

A largely online customer base allows for 80% of this age group play online multiplayer games, mostly male.

The most prominent recent success story being **Balatro**, a game combining poker with roguelike mechanics, which won **"Best Independent Game"** at The Game Awards 2024 and sold over 500,000 copies within the first three months.

Just Snap aims to capitalise on the visibility of such successful titles in the niche with its a blend of superb music and satisfying gameplay allowing it to further stand out from them. 

Our research indicates a clear demand for engaging, skill-based card games with high replayability, and our competitive analysis confirms that no existing game fully explores the intersection between card strategy and rhythm mechanics.

## **2.2 Market Research & Validation**

Our research strategy combines quantitative and qualitative approaches:

- **Web Scraping:** Scraping the steam store page and analysing genre popularity based on user-assigned tags, as well as profitability within those genres.
- **Surveys**: Conducted through Google Forms targeting university coding and computer science society members (20 respondents) via social media.
- **Interviews**: In-depth discussions with video game developers at FyreFlight Games and FatShark studios.
- **Play-testing**: We will invite University of Bath students to an open testing event, where they can try our game in an early development stage and share feedback.

### **Developer Interviews**

We spoke to specialists in the indie video games industry and have received helpful advice to direct  our product and strategy:

**Vedanshu Mahajan, Founder of FyreFlight Games**

"Are there any similar games that haven't done that well? A good exercise is looking at them and thinking about what you will do better, whether that's just having better production or ideas or something you'll directly improve."

**Andrew Claridge, Senior Software Engineer at Fatshark Studios:** 

“Bloingo Game’s concept of a game based on traditional card game mechanics with added rhythm elements seems like a sound first project for a new studio. Selecting a mechanics-heavy, asset-light deliverable is a strategic choice for a technical team. The integration of proven game mechanics with roguelike elements minimises the risk of the team getting stuck finding the fun while still offering solid replayability without the need to handcraft a lot of content.

Current generation examples like Slay the Spire, and more recently, Balatro lend weight to this approach - both succeeded by innovating within established card game frameworks adding fun and replayable gameplay without needing an extensive library of assets or narrative elements.**6.6 Limitations and Constraints**
The selection of Godot as the development engine is a prudent technical decision. Using an established game engine lets the team stand up a prototype quickly and spend time iterating on their game’s unique mechanics. It also makes it easier to scale the team later during production if needed. The choice of Godot fits the game genre well and sidesteps Unity’s recent business model instability which would be a significant risk factor for a startup.” 

In light of Fyreflight’s recommendations, we also looked at games who haven’t performed so well, despite having an idea that seemed promising, or even gameplay which looked engaging, to see where they fell short on their projects. Some things we were able to establish: 

- Something an unsuccessful project did wrong
- Another thing they did wrong
- Perhaps a third thing

Our correspondence with Fatshark reaffirmed our choice of development engine. As well as this, Andrew’s extensive experience at Fatshark, where he’s currently creating the new Warhammer game, confirms that Bloingo’s direction for our first game project is a viable one, where we have made sound strategic decisions up to this point.

…

### Web Scraping

A web scrape was done to identify trends in **supply** and **demand** across a variety of game categories. An intuitive way to capture this is average revenue per game.

We wrote a python script that scraped key data from over 200,000 Steam store pages, collecting: user-reviews, pricing, user-defined tags, released dates, and more. Using review counts and game prices, we estimated sales and revenue using standard techniques like the [Boxleiter method](http://greyaliengames.com/blog/how-to-estimate-how-many-sales-a-steam-game-has-made/), then modeled how these numbers might trend over time.

We analysed which genres and themes tended to perform best with respect to average revenue per game, and customer satisfaction given by review score.

**Key Insights:**

- Indie games that were given the “Nostalgia” tag by users, generated more revenue per game than any other in the past 5 years, showing there's high demand for this theme.
- Amongst games priced at less than £10, which contained over 400 tags, “Card Game” had the 4th highest average user rating and “Roguelike Deckbuilder” was close behind in 10th position.
- The most universally trending tag across all price ranges was  “Great Soundtrack”.
- Out of all games listed on the Steam store page, only 8 have both “Card Game” and “Rhythm” tags, with only one being even remotely similar to our idea.

This data solidified our choice of video game idea, revealing a trend towards musically rich games and making it clear that card games are a flourishing market for low-budget game development teams. On top of this, in the face of these discovered trends, the combination of card games and rhythm reveals a niche that hasn't been tapped into.

**Cumulative Revenue per Game per Tag | Under £10**

![image.png](Appendix/image%202.png)

### **Survey Insights**

From our survey of 20 respondents, here are the key findings:

**Cross-genre interest**: Almost all of those surveyed reported interest (rated at 3/5 or above) in a card game incorporating rhythm mechanics, with a majority scoring at least 4/5, and 65% voted “unique rhythm-based mechanics that interact with deckbuilding” as the feature that would most make our game stand out to them. With no direct competitor in that space, this validates our target niche.

**Skill Over Luck**: 85% want a card-based game that requires deeper strategy and less randomness and luck-based mechanics

![image.webp](Appendix/image.webp)

**A Focus on Gameplay**: Only 20% reported interest in story and worldbuilding as compared to an overwhelming majority in various aspects of gameplay. When pressed further, 40% said they “don’t really care about story in deckbuilders,” and 25% specifically that they “prefer games to be more focused on mechanics”.

![image.webp](Appendix/image%201.webp)

**Looks Matter**: Around half of respondents care about the aesthetic value of their games beyond the gameplay itself. With the “retro” tag trending in the charts, this gives a clear artistic direction to the project, and our team’s in-house artistic expertise allows us pull it off convincingly and at low cost.

![image.webp](Appendix/image%202.webp)

**Multiplayer is Essential:** In addition to a compelling Steam data trend in games tagged as ‘*multiplayer*’, our respondents made it clear that they would much rather play with others than alone. When asked specifically about this, a resounding 85% would find “being able to play a game like this with friends/family” appealing.

![image.webp](Appendix/image%203.webp)

**Gameplay Balance:** While the vote for strategic and skill-based gameplay is unanimous, around half of players insist on the incorporation of random and unexpected gameplay elements to keep them on their toes. Only a small minority asked for “minimal randomness.”

![image.webp](Appendix/image%204.webp)

**Replay Value:** When voting on the features that would make our game stand out, “high replayability and unlockable content” came in first with 65% of responses. For a deckbuilder game, this lends itself well to a monetisation model that includes regular DLC releases to keep things novel for players.

## **2.2 Co**mp**etitor Analysis**

While our idea is completely unique (as no games currently exist that combine the card and rhythm genres), we still have competition in both spaces. We have performed analysis on projects of a similar scope to our own, which share similar aesthetics and are in the same price range. These particular games may be considered by a customer as an alternative to Just Snap.

### **Direct Competitors**

1. **Card-Based Roguelikes**:
    - **Slay the Spire**: Strong strategic depth but lacks variety.
    - **Balatro**: Recent success with poker mechanics but limited progression.
2. **Rhythm Games**:
    - **Beat Saber**: Market leader in VR rhythm games but lacks strategic elements. (Also it’s VR = vomit repeatedly)
    - **Crypt of the NecroDancer**: Closest to our concept but lacks deck-building mechanics, instead opting for rhythm based movement. (Does it lack deck building? Oh well sounds like a great negative point
    - **Everhood 2:** A particular focus on narrative, although not done well according to reviews

### **Everhood 2**

| **Strengths**:

• Fun rhythm based gameplay endorsed by positive and negative reviewers.
• Resonant pixel art aesthetic.
• Rich worldbuilding due to variety in characters and environments . | **Weaknesses**:

• Confusing narrative - disjointed story telling.
• Lacklustre music, lacking variety.
• Niche appeal - potential customer base is small.
 |
| --- | --- |
| **Opportunities**:

• Demand for diverse soundtrack, as seen in Steam’s ‘Great Soundtrack’ tag trend
• Players seeking simpler, engaging narratives over complex lore  | **Threats**:

• Dynamic changes in market - potential players fatigue if nostalgia trend fades
• 
 |

### RODB: Rhythm of Deck Builder

| **Strengths**:

• Taps into card game + rhythm niche, which we have identified as trending.
• Capitalises on anime themes which have a large following. | **Weaknesses**:

• Simplistic music.
• Does not tap into nostalgia genre.
• Gameplay looks boring.
• Not multiplayer |
| --- | --- |
| **Opportunities**:

• Allows us to distinguish our product by comparison with higher quality music and more engaging multiplayer gameplay.
• Opportunity for converting followers over to our game. | **Threats**:

• Game is being released in a similar timeframe to ours. Serves as a direct competitor to our game, especially if they release before us. Could satisfy a portion of our potential customer base enough to disuade them from buying our game. |

### **Crypt of the NecroDancer**

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
| --- | --- |
| • Established player base in rhythm-roguelike space.<br>• Successful implementation of lore.<br>• Strong brand recognition.<br>• Proven core mechanics.<br>• Excellent, innovative gameplay. | • Limited strategic depth.<br>• Aging visual design. Is its aesthetic dated or fashionable?<br>• Less satisfying progression system. |
| **🟩Opportunities** | **Threats** |
| --- | --- |
| • Players seeking deeper strategic elements.<br>• Can create a more profound lore and universe.<br>• Can relate our game to something people know and love.<br>• Collaboration, endorsement, sponsorship (local companies, brands, advertising). | • Brand loyalty among existing players.<br>• Budget is far superior to ours.<br>• Movement is logically combined with rhythm.<br>• Possible sequel development. |


# **3. Strategy**

## **3.1 Team & Roles**

Our team consists of five postgraduate students within the computer science department, who are also avid video game enthusiasts with a large pool of skills and experiences:

- **Robert Ruta, Technical Lead, Developer**: Experienced in Unity game development, C# and Python, and has previously worked as a data scientist and software developer. Loves games.
- **Chris Seadon, Game Design Lead, Developer**: Skilled programmer with extensive experience developing games in Godot. Talented artist and professional music producer.
- **Jake Abrahams, UI Designer, Developer**: Skilled Java and Python programmer. Talented artist and professional musician.
- **Plato Ng, Data Scientist, Head of Marketing**: Experienced in data analysis, market research and advertising.
- **Francis Rowlands, Business Development Executive, Customer Engagement**: Considerable industry experience in sales, networking and teaching. Having spent many years living abroad, Francis also has a lot of experience building rapport with foreign companies, and speaks 4 languages.

### **Legal Status and Organizational Structure**

Bloingo Games Ltd will operate as a Private Limited Company with Companies House (registration no. pending), providing the team with liability protection under a separate legal entity. The address will be on the University of Bath site, leveraging the academic institution's entrepreneurial ecosystem to support the studio's early development. All five co-founders will serve as directors and shareholders.

The company's digital presence has already been initiated through domain registration, establishing the foundation for the studio's online brand identity ahead of formal company registration.

~~All assets produced in-house are the intellectual property of Bloingo Games Ltd~~

**Ownership Structure**

All five founding members will serve as directors and owners of Bloingo Games Ltd, taking on the legal responsibilities outlined in the Companies Act 2006, as well as the initial share capital. Leadership will be collaborative, with all major strategic decisions requiring unanimous agreement among the directors.

Bloingo Games Ltd will file annual accounts and confirmation statements with Companies House, ensuring full compliance with statutory requirements.A reserve of shares will be stored for allocation to future collaborators and potential investors, facilitating company growth and talent acquisition as the studio expands.

**Organisational Structure**

Bloingo Games Ltd employs a flat organisational structure that prioritizes agility, creativity, and mutual contribution over traditional hierarchical model values. When leadership is required on certain elements of the game, it is assigned based individual expertise and the project requirements, allowing the team to remain adaptable in the rapidly evolving gaming market.

The core team consists of five founding members with complementary skills spanning game design, programming, art direction, sound design, marketing, networking, and sales. This diverse skill set enables Bloingo Games Ltd to handle most development functions in-house during the initial growth phase, reducing dependency on external contractors and maintaining creative control over projects.

## **3.2 Launch and Marketing**

At launch, creating a strong online presence, engaging with our community and gathering feedback will maximise visibility and player interest while keeping costs efficient (REFERENCE). All of this serves the company’s goal of publishing **Just Snap** on Steam, the largest PC gaming marketplace which has more than 132 million active users each month ([Kumar, 2025](https://www.demandsage.com/steam-statistics)).

Designing a storefront as early as possible, with professional, broadly appealing artwork and product descriptions has been shown to significantly boost sales of games on Steam (REFERENCE). This is largely due to Steam’s ‘wishlist’ feature, which allows users to easily save upcoming games to their wishlist allowing them to be notified upon the game’s release.

High-quality trailers also generate sales (REFERENCE), and will create the opportunity to advertise **Just Snap’s** USP: blending strategic deck-building with rhythmic precision. Heavily featuring videos on the storefront is particularly important for a rhythm game, as it promotes the ‘Great Soundtrack’ created in response to this growing trend in the industry (*reference ourselves – the survey section*).

As this is a clear avenue for boosting the product’s revenue at launch, significant effort is going into these storefront assets, making use of the experienced artists on our team.

Based on wishlists, Steam titles see roughly a 20% median conversion rate in the first week after release ([Game If You Are](https://gameifyouare.com/2022/12/15/how-many-steam-wishlists-does-my-indie-game-need/), 2022).

| ***Wishlists:*** | ***500*** | ***1000*** | ***2000*** | ***4000*** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Min Converted Sales (10%):* | *50* | *100* | *200* | *400* |
| *Max Converted Sales (20%):* | *100* | *200* | *400* | *800* |
| *Expected Revenue (**£)**:* | *225* | *671* | *1341* | *2682* |

Given these metrics, our projected revenue from wishlist conversion would range from £1,600 to £6,400.

Further to this, outlets for community outreach such as social media posts and online outreach are vital for increasing engagement with the store page ([Big Games Machine, 2025](https://www.biggamesmachine.com/steam-next-fest-marketing-strategies/)).

Posting clips of the game on influential platforms such as TikTok – with its 1.9 billion users ([SEO AI, 2025](https://seo.ai/blog/how-many-users-on-tiktok#:~:text=TikTok%20Key%20Statistics-,TikTok%20has%201%2C925%20billion%20users%20globally%2C%20with%20170%20million%20monthly,with%20billions%20of%20views%20each).) – will promote sales, and the creation of a Discord server, anchoring our community by providing them with development updates and garnering their input, is a strategy that has been successfully executed by Supergiant Games with *Hades* ([Why Hades was a Success, 2024](https://benjaminglover.substack.com/p/why-hades-was-a-success)). Additionally, building partnerships with influencers, particularly those that specialise in the roguelike deckbuilder and rhythm genres, will accelerate exposure ([Mega Cat Studios, 2024](https://megacatstudios.com/blogs/game-development/mastering-influencer-marketing-game-developers-guide?srsltid=AfmBOoqiw6bLw1IRR79j1ZyI5X_zwvM1ETf9gqCKxOlHk8BnrsNDyKKg)).

In addition to these online strategies, generating word-of-mouth buzz at in-person events is vital for a game’s public awareness on release (REFERENCE). Our team will attend fairs at the University of Bath, including [the monthly Bath Video Game Society LAN sessions](https://www.thesubath.com/bvgs/). Indie games meetups in Bristol, including the [Bristol Indie Developers](https://www.meetup.com/bristol-indie-developers/) sessions, and larger conventions in London such as EGX (REFERENCE) will allow us to build a local following. Furthermore, the [Bristol Games Hub](https://bristol.games/#meetups) will provide easy access to other regular local networking events and communities centred around game development, such as the [BGH Antisocial Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bristolgameshub/).

Using this local following, it will be possible to host in-person play testing events pre-release, allowing for the collection of customer feedback and evaluation of our core gaming mechanics. (*should expand on this probably)*

## **3.3 Funding Strategy**

Our team will be using a combination of crowdfunding, grants and personal investments to finance the project beyond development. With marketing being our most significant variable expense, financial surplus can be directed towards maximising publicity and outreach. Once the product is ready, additional income will translate directly into scaling sales.

**Sources of Funding:**

| Crowdfunding | Kickstarter | 4,000 | A platform which has successfully crowdfunded countless other indie video games of similar scope. Our analysis of other projects on the platform suggests that this is a reasonable target figure. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Grants | University Grants | 5,000 | A winning pitch to the Bath Enterprise entrepreneurship program would secure a £5,000 investment. |
|  | Transfuzer Grants | 7,500 | Transfuzer offer grants to support prototype development for startup game dev studios. |
|  | UKGTF Grant | 2,000 | UKGTF Indie Game Development £2,000 grant applications open soon. |
|  | UK Games Fund | 5,000 | Grant applications open from June. |

Whilst grant applications are low effort, they also have low chance of success due to the large number of competitors. Kickstarter on the other hand allows us to leverage the undersupplied niche we are targeting with our game, drawing on the power of community and loyalty to generate funding. As a result, we treat our Kickstarter campaign as our primary and most likely source of external funding. 

### **Kickstarter Breakdown**

Many such projects are successful (examples?), and there are notable examples of runaway hits on the indie market, such as [Hollow Knight](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight), that demonstrate the potential for community-backed funding. In fact, [most successful game Kickstarter campaigns aim for under $10,000](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats).

Our Kickstarter funding target is: £4,000.

[Ongoing Kickstarter Campaigns Analysis](Appendix/Ongoing%20Kickstarter%20Campaigns%20Analysis%201bde964524c58006ae1dee0895ddf4e2.md)

**Kickstarter Tier Model**

| **Tier** | **Price (£)** | **Rewards** | **Est. Backers** | **Revenue (£)** |

**Projected Net Kickstarter Revenue After Fees: £3,720**

Kickstarter takes 5% platform fee, plus 3-5% payment processing fee (~8% total).

## 3.4 Cost Analysis and Revenue Strategy

### Pricing Model

Analysing game pricing for games similar in scope, style and quality we found the most popular price to be between £8 and £9. 

Steam’s automatic price conversion for games priced at $9.99 is explained [here](https://steamdb.info/blog/valve-price-matrix-2022-update/). Using this information we arrived at the price points shown in the table below.

| **Revenue Breakdown** | **Value (UK)** | **Value (USA)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Price | £7.99 | £9.99 |
| VAT (20%) | £-1.60 | £-2.00 |
| Steam Fee (30% after VAT) | £-1.92 | £-2.40 |
| **Gross Revenue per Sale** | **£4.47** | **£5.59** |

Setting the price between **£5–£15**  aligns with industry norms for indie titles with less than 10 hours of content ([GameDev Subreddit, 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/jancdd/what_was_your_indie_game_pricing_strategy/)) with the [average price for indie games](https://howtomarketagame.com/2022/08/17/are-indie-games-too-cheap/) being £5.60 as of 2022.

As our game has been designed for well over 10 hours of replayability in mind, we feel £7.99 is an appropriate price for our product.

### Sales Revenue Projections

We simulated our first game’s sales curves based on Steam game review graphs available on their store pages. To keep our projections realistic, we hand-picked a selection of 5 games similar in scope, style and theme, and considered three scenarios:

**Conservative scenario:** 2,000 total sales before 2027

**Expected scenario:** 7,000 total sales before 2027

**Optimistic scenario:** 20,000 total sales before 2027

![image.png](Appendix/image%204.png)

After a discussion within the team, we found that on average, members valued their labour at a rate of $60 per hour. After taking into account how much of this amount we would be happy to treat as investments into the company, and the value we retain from ownership of the company itself, we arrived at the conclusion that generating revenue surpassing $10 per hour from our first game could be treated as a success.

We used this rate together with an assumed average of 11 hours of work per member per week to create the reference revenue threshold on the graph above. All revenue earned above this threshold will be treated as profit that will be used for reinvestment back into the company and its projects.

|  | Asset store purchases | £0.00 | £200.00 | Sometimes the cost of making assets yourself is greater than the price of already made assets available for purchase on an asset store |
| Marketing & Community | Social media Ads  *(Fb, IG, Twitter, etc...)* | £0.00 | £300.00 | Social media ads get pretty expensive before they're worthwhile. Maybe we should leave it. |
|  | Influencer / Streamer Outreach | £0.00 | £250.00 | The meaning of 'influencer' can be broad. A small-timer or local might settle for a free Steam key |
|  | Domain Name *(Bloingo.com)* | £10.00 | £10.00 |  |
|  | Incentives *(eg. playtesting, surveys)* | £0 | £200.00 | Survey participants were entered into a draw cappuccinos, and events might provide snacks, etc. |
| Setup & Legal | Steam Direct | £0 | £80.00 | $100 per game or free if we manage to publish via Robert’s  |
|  | Companies House | £0.00 | £50.00 | If we were to register it as a sole proprietorship, costs are 0. A limited company comes with a 50gbp fee. |

| Multiplayer Infrastructure | Game Servers *(AWS, Azure)* | £0.00 | £20.00 | PAYG, region dependant - the basic AWS models start at something like 4p/hr. P2P would defer this cost (ie. clients share timestamps for local comparison) |

**Total Estimated Development Cost**

After reviewing the minimum and maximum potential expenses outlined, we anticipate spending £2,000 overall. This figure assumes in-house asset production, a lean marketing campaign, basic legal registration, and mitigated server costs. Developer salaries are not included. If additional grants are obtained or our Kickstarter targets exceeded, further funds will be put towards marketing to maximise growth.

Our ROI calculations also assume £2,000 as the baseline.

### **Return on Investment Projections, by 2027**

Based on comparable indie game performance metrics and our conservative sales estimates:

| **Scenario** | **Unit Sales** | **Revenue (£)** | **Profit (£)** | **ROI** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Conservative | 2,000 | £8,940 | £6,940  | 347% |
| Expected | 7,000 | £31,290 | £29,290 | 1,465% |
| Optimistic | 20,000 | £89,400 | £87,400   | 4,370% |

These projections account for Steam's 30% platform fee and £7.99 price point, but for simplicity assume no additional marketing expenditure beyond initial budget or further revenue streams such as DLC release.

## **3.5 Risk Assessment and Mitigation**

## Development Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Technical challenges integrating rhythm and card mechanics | High | Early prototyping and leveraging development experience to identify and resolve technical issues early. |
| Limited resources extending development timeline | Moderate | Clearly defining MVP features, conducting regular scope review meetings, and using a modular design approach to allow for flexible development. |
| Team time constraints due to academic commitments | High | Establishing a realistic and clear division of responsibilities aligned with academic calendars to ensure manageable workloads. |

## Market Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oversaturation of the indie game market | Very High | Ensuring strong differentiation through a unique genre combination and conducting targeted marketing to specific player demographics and communities. |
| Negative reception from the core audience | High | Running an early access period for player feedback, conducting extensive playtesting with target populations, and using an agile development approach to address user concerns. |
| Limited marketing reach due to budget constraints | High | Initially focusing on building strong, small communities and then expanding outreach to content creators, university networks, and events once the game establishes a strong reputation. |

## Financial Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unexpected development costs | High | Following a phased development approach with a tiered structure to align with available budget. Leveraging university resources to reduce costs. Considering the need for a buffer in case of budget overruns. |
| Insufficient projected sales | High | Keeping initial development costs low, using conservative financial projections, and adopting a bootstrapped approach to sustain development. |
| Failure to reach the Kickstarter funding goal | Medium | Preparing a tiered development plan that adjusts to different funding levels. Identifying alternative funding sources such as grants, schemes, and charitable organisations. |

## 3.6 Reinvestment and Scaling Strategy

**Stretch Goals:**

- **£3,000** – Add a new themed deck (e.g., Wizards) + 3 new soundtracks
- **£5,000** – 6 additional soundtracks, 3 new card themes, and special celebratory DLC for all players
- **£10,000** – Mobile version (iOS/Android) releases, chance to meet the developers at a gaming convention, plus a potential Nintendo Switch port depending on feedback.

## **4. Contribution Split**

| **Team Member** | **Role** | **Split** | **Responsibilities** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Robert | Technical Lead | 20% | Game architecture, core systems, technical implementation |
| Chris | Game Design Lead | 20% | Game design, balancing, player experience |
| Jake | Development Lead | 20% | Feature implementation, UI programming, QA |
| Plato | Data & Analytics Lead | 20% | User testing, data analysis, marketing |

## **6.4 Financial Documentation - *I think this will go in 3.3***

 a financially sound approach for bringing "Just Snap" to the market with risk being minimised and giving it great potential for return on investment

This funding strategy presents a financially sound approach for bringing "Just Snap" to the market with risk being minimised and giving it great potential for return on investment.

By leveraging our team's existing expertise, university resources, and the demonstrated  interest in a game combining card and rhythm elements, we believe Bloingo Games represents an attractive investment opportunity.

**6.6 Limitations and Constraints**

1. **Early Store Page:**
    - Create a steam store page as soon as possible, with high quality production grade marketing material
    - Appeal to Steam’s recommendation algorithm by garnering ‘Wishlist’ subscriptions prior to release.
2. **Live playtesting event**:
    - Invite others to play the game in its MVP state 2 weeks prior to release, noting direct feedback on our product.
    - Keep in touch with attendees by providing weekly updates based on community feedback, email and Discord notifications, as well as directing them to our other socials.
    - Focus on building a dedicated player community with a dedicated Discord server, Instagram and TikTok channels.
