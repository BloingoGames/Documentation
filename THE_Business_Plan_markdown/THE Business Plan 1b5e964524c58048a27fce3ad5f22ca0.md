## **1.1. Executive Summary**

### **Mission Statement & Introduction**

**Literally Just Snap** is an innovative new game that combines the strategic, tactical nature of card games with the satisfying, challenging beats of rhythm games, enhanced with a thrilling multiplayer experience and popular ‘roguelike’ mechanics.

This is the first game being designed and developed by **Bloingo Games,** a new game studio striving to create groundbreaking games that both capitalise on market trends and bring new innovations to the gaming industry.

### **~~Problem Solved and Solution~~**

The games market is saturated with card and rhythm games. However, nobody has combined the two in order to tap into both demographics simultaneously. 

A combination of these two genres could break new ground and provide solutions to problems in each:

- **Card Games**: Often repetitive, lacking rewards and incentives to keep players motivated. Seasoned players find them too simple after a short period.
- **Rhythm Games**: More innovative at their core than card games, but they often lack more developed ideas and become repetitive over time. (Lore/narrative as well?)

**Literally Just Snap** overcomes these challenges by combining the strategic, yet easy-to-learn nature of card games, with the complex, high difficulty ceilings of rhythm games. Our concept ensures an addictive and engaging gameplay loop that satisfies both casual gamers and seasoned professionals alike, creating a playful sandbox for music lovers and button-pushers. (Too avant-gardes)

### **Competitive Advantages**

- **First-mover Advantage**: Currently, no games exist that combine these two genres. The introduction of rhythm concepts into a card game is our unique selling point.
- **Experienced Team:** With a team of seasoned developers: talent specifically recruited for their knowledge of these genres, we can focus on polishing our unique concept and creating an incredibly high-quality product from the get-go.
- **Cross-platform Strategy**: We are planning to develop the game for the PC market, but with considerations made for mobile platforms: this will allow us to plan a mobile release, unlocking a completely new market, as soon as possible.
- **Scope:** As our first game, we have focused on a simple yet innovative, easy-to-develop concept that will ensure a fast release and allow us to promptly start working on our next innovation, adding to our flexibility in a fast-moving market.

***Financial Projections should probably go in Market or Strategy. Product should focus more on wow factor of our USP and ‘design’***

## **1.2 Problem & Customer Needs**

### **Customer Pain Points**

- **Digital Card Games**:
    - Games like *Pokémon Pocket*, *Magic: The Gathering Arena*, and *Hearthstone* rely heavily on RNG and pay-to-win mechanics, alienating casual players.
    - Progression feels meaningless, as players aren’t permanently rewarded for engagement.
    - Staying competitive requires significant financial investment, often through RNG-based loot boxes.
- **Digital Casino/Recreational Card Games**:
    - Poor monetisation and retention strategies due to one-dimensional gameplay.
    - Repetitive mechanics lead to player burnout.
- **Rhythm Games**:
    - High skill ceilings make them inaccessible to casual players.
    - Lack of narrative depth and lore reduces long-term engagement.
- **Roguelike Games**:
    - Starting over each time can feel unrewarding, making players feel like they haven’t made progress.
    - Poorly implemented procedural generation can lead to repetitive or frustrating gameplay.

## **1.3 Solution (Value Proposition)**

### **Product Description**

**Literally Just Snap** is a multiplayer card-rhythm game in which players can build powerful decks of cards – each with their own unique abilities. Loosely based on traditional card games such as ‘snap’, it is easy to pick up, but the complex combinations of these collectable cards, combined with precise musically-timed moves, makes it hard to master.

With competitive, high-stakes multiplayer action akin to the likes of *Uno*(tm) and ‘war’, players will compete to collect all of the cards in play and win the game. To do so, they must ‘snap’ their cards with other players’ by competing in rhythm-based battles to secure their opponents’ hands: all synchronised to a bespoke soundtrack designed specifically for the game.

But that’s not all: players each have their own set of special **Bloingo** **cards, collected over time both by playing the game and through purchases in the in-game shop. These special cards will turn the game upside-down: reversing, speeding up or slowing down the music, stealing other players’ cards and more. This chaotic element in an otherwise skill-based game has been carefully thought out to raise the stakes in each and every game, enabling seasoned players and newcomers alike to compete with one another. 

These unique cards ensure that every play-through is different: just like contemporary roguelikes like *Slay the Spire* and *Hades*, limitless combinations (‘builds’) of cards can be devised to create endless possibilities.

### **Value Delivery**

- **Functional Value**: Strategic deck-building combined with skill-based rhythm gameplay creates a deeper, more engaging experience than either genre alone.
- **Emotional Value**: Progression through the roguelike elements gives the user great satisfaction, even after failure. The rhythmic elements of the game provide mood enhancing music and satisfying gameplay.
- **Economic Value**: The payment model we will use. I suggest an initial steam cost (£1.99 - £9.99) and then the option to buy skins/coats for the cards, arenas, characters. No gacha boxes (As much as I love a loot box).

### **Customer-Focused Design Principles**

With our market research in mind, we are designing a game that prioritises:

- **Skill > RNG**: Player performance matters more than rewards and victories depending on random chance.
- **Strategic Deck Building**: Cards modify rhythm gameplay in meaningful ways.
- **Balanced Difficulty Curve**: Accessible to newcomers while providing challenge for veterans.
- **Persistent Progression**: The more you play, the more you are rewarded (meta-progression?)

## **1.4 Product Differentiation & Innovation**

### **Unique Gameplay Mechanics**

- **Rhythmic Card Activation**: Cards are played in time with the music, adding a tactical layer to rhythm gameplay. (This is one way to implement it, it could of course just affect a timer, as opposed to having to play moves in time to rhythm).
- **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**: AI-driven system that adjusts challenge based on player skill. (Is this even possible? Probably not - AI for Rob as Rob loves AI). This is essentially EOMM, but somehow less cancerous than Marvel Rivals matchmaking
- **Level Generation**: Would it be procedurally generated? Or look like a casino table/deck?
- **Meta-Progression System**: Roguelike nature means that when something is unlocked, it stays unlocked.

### **Innovation Classification**

Bloingaroo Blythm performs **"disruptive innovation" (apparently the buzzword)** by creating an entirely new category of gameplay experience. While individual elements exist in other games, this combination we are employing conceives an entirely new product that can attract players from multiple already established genres of game.

***Development Roadmap belongs in 3. Strategy***

# **2. Market**

### **Why Invest in Bloingo Games?**

As of Q1 2025, the global video game industry is worth **£218B**. Within this market, indie games and hybrid genres have seen exponential growth, with market values of **£22.5B** and **£8.7B**, respectively.

The most prominent recent success story is **Balatro**, a game combining poker with roguelike mechanics, which won **"Best Independent Game"** at The Game Awards 2024 and sold over 500,000 copies within three months.

BloingoGames Studios is in an excellent position to capitalise on this trend by creating a sustainable business model that doesn’t rely solely on the success of one game. We predict a **100% return on investment** over a two-year period.

## **2.1 Market Research & Validation**

Our research strategy combines quantitative and qualitative approaches:

- **Web Scrapping:** Scraping the steam store page and analysing genre popularity based on user-assigned tags.
- **Surveys**: Conducted through SurveyMonkey targeting university coding and computer science society members (85 respondents) via Discord and Outlook.
- **Interviews**: In-depth discussions with 6 indie game developers from the UK and Sweden (can claim we spoke to my step brother who works for Fatshark if we need to?)
- **Playtesting**: Early concept testing with 15 gamers from diverse gaming backgrounds – (perhaps something we should mention we’ll consider doing).
- **Could mention ‘Mom test’** – a way to avoid bias whilst getting data within samples of people who may know you

### The Web Scrape

The motivation behind the web scrape, was to collect data that would allow us to identify trends in **supply $S$**, **demand** $D$, and ultimately **need** *$N$*across a variety of game categories. **Need** $N$ is a metric we came up with to identify areas of low supply and high demand. It just so happens that a very nice and intuitive way to capture this turned out to be average revenue per game (per category):

$$
N = \frac{D}{S} = \frac{Total \space Revenue}{Number \space of \space Released \space Games} = Average \space Revenue \space per \space Game.
$$

This measure is by no means bulletproof, as for instance, **need** would rapidly approach infinity as **supply** approached 0, but nonetheless we found that it allowed us to quickly identify categories that were truly trending after cross-checking with google trends analytics.

**The Analysis**

We wrote a python script that scraped data from every accessible store page on Steam. From each steam game we collected: user reviews, pricing, user defined tags, release dates, and more. Unfortunately, none of this was direct data on sales and revenue over time, so we had to extrapolate:

1. We approximated total game sales from number of reviews via a fine-tuned implementation of 
the [Boxleiter method](https://greyaliengames.com/blog/how-to-estimate-how-many-sales-a-steam-game-has-made/).
2. We multiplied this by the game’s listed steam price to get total revenue.
3. For each game, we simulated sales and revenue curves over time by spreading their initial totals over 12 month windows using an exponential decay curve.

Whilst this is generally imprecise, it was precise enough for us to identify trends across video game categories. 

We defined these categories with user-defined tags. Since tags ranged in their generality, with some encapsulating vast segments of the market like “Indie”, and others pinpointing specific aesthetics like “Noir”, we grouped tags based on their broadness and analysed the groups separately.

Using these groups we created cooccurrence matrices with a variety of aggregation methods in order to evaluate which combinations of tags had the highest reviews, revenues, and more.

**The Insights**

From this data we were able to come up with sales and revenue projections based on user-reviews and game pricing.

A detailed analysis of over 200,000 store pages lead us to some interesting findings:

- Indie games that were given the “Nostalgia” tag by users, generated more revenue per game than any other tag in the past 5 years, suggesting there's high demand for this theme.
- Amongst games priced at less than £10, out of over 400 tags, “Card Game” had the 4th highest average user rating and “Roguelike Deckbuilder” was close behind at 10th position.
- The most universally trending tag across all price ranges was the “Great Soundtrack” tag.
- Out of all games listed on the Steam store page, only 8 have both “Card Game” and “Rhythm” tags, and only one is even remotely similar to our idea.

This data drove us in the direction of the video game idea we eventually settled on. It revealed a trend towards musically rich games and made it clear that card games are a flourishing market for low-budget game dev teams. On top of this, in the face of these discovered trends, the combination of card games and rhythm appears to reveal a niche that hasn't been tapped into.

### **Key Market Insights**

From our survey of 20 respondents, here are some key findings:

- **Cross-genre interest**: Almost all of those surveyed reported interest (rated at 3/5 or above) in a card game incorporating rhythm mechanics, with a majority scoring at least 4/5. A sizeable 65% voted “unique rhythm-based mechanics that interact with deckbuilding” as the feature that would most make our game stand out to them.
- **Skill Over Luck**: 85% want a card-based game that requires deeper strategy and less randomness and luck-based mechanics

![image.webp](THE%20Business%20Plan%201b5e964524c58048a27fce3ad5f22ca0/image.webp)

- **A Focus on Gameplay**: Only 20% reported interested in story and worldbuilding as compared to an overwhelming majority in various aspects gameplay. When pressed further, 40% said they “don’t really care about story in deckbuilders,” and 25% specifically that they “prefer games to be more focused on mechanics”.

![image.webp](THE%20Business%20Plan%201b5e964524c58048a27fce3ad5f22ca0/image%201.webp)

- **Looks Matter**: Around half or respondents care about the aesthetic value of their games beyond the gameplay itself. With the “retro” tag rending in the charts, this gives a clear artistic direction to the project, and our team’s in-house artistic expertise allows us pull it off convincingly and at low cost.

![image.webp](THE%20Business%20Plan%201b5e964524c58048a27fce3ad5f22ca0/image%202.webp)

- **Multiplayer is Essential:** In addition to a compelling Steam data trend in games tagged as ‘*multiplayer*’, our respondents made it clear that they would much rather play with others than alone. When asked specifically about this, a resounding 85% would find “being able to play a game like this with friends/family” appealing.

![image.webp](THE%20Business%20Plan%201b5e964524c58048a27fce3ad5f22ca0/image%203.webp)

- **Gameplay Balance:** While the vote strategic and skill-based gameplay is unanimous, around half of players insist on the incorporation of random and unexpected gameplay elements to keep them on their toes. Only a small majority asked for “minimal randomness.”

![image.webp](THE%20Business%20Plan%201b5e964524c58048a27fce3ad5f22ca0/image%204.webp)

- **Replay Value:** When voting on the features that would make our game stand out, “high replayability and unlockable content” came in first with 65% of responses. For a deckbuilder game, this lends itself well to a monetisation model that includes regular DLC releases to keep things novel for players.

    - **Pre-Orders**: Generate £____ through Steam Early Access and itch.io pre-orders.
    - Internal investor: (knows an alumni in Leeds who actively looking for investing in entrepreneur start-ups, happy to shoot her a dm when the business plan is up – not guaranteed but worth a record as an attempt)

> I wouldn’t be sure how to estimate pre-orders, would we break it down as part of a sales forecast and then split it by date? (3 options imo, 1. free + DLC, 2. pay-to-play 3. pay-to-play + optional DLCs) option 2 is easier to estimate, option 1 & 3 are slightly more complicated but feasible.
> 

**decision**: Pay-to-play + optional DLCs. 

- **Sales Forecast**:
    - Year 1: £500 (200 units sold at £2.50 each).
    - Year 2: £2,000 (additional 1,000 units plus DLC sales).
    - Year 3: £5,000 (continued sales plus integrated mobile implementation).
