General notes from Chris template adjustment:

Product, Market, Strategy headings added (they really want these + it wasn't clear to me which means it wouldn't have been clear to them)

'development roadmap' moved to Strategy section

'Product' section should have some visuals - logos, mockups. Make it look nice and present clear plans for a product

'with summaries to support your market validation in the Market Section. You do not need that data in the Product Section, which states the customer needs and how your product/service addresses them without validating those needs there'  - from mark scheme -- most of the stats in the Product section probably don't need to be there

we have a 'key market insights' section that should be covering what's currently in the product section as 'market research and validation'. One of these is redundant, I've moved the nicer one to 'key market insights'. Same info but more concise, easy to find (given their mark scheme and how they'll be scanning the paper)

'Market Size and Growth Potential' essentially just repeats 'Why Invest in Bloigo Games?' - these could be combined

we don't need use cases AND user scenarios imo. One or the other, we don't want this longer than 10 pages and they're almost the same thing (except use cases are more helpful and easier to read)

market entry strategy 100% belongs in Strategy section

a lot of Francis' extra info (currently in appendix) like capital requirements, resources like art+music assets, revenue model, tools and tech, and *definitely* risk assessment belongs in the Strategy section as well
