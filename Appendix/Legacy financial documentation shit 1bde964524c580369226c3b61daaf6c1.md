s a financially sound approach for bringing "Just Snap" to the market with risk being minimised and giving it great potential for return on investment

This funding strategy presents a financially sound approach for bringing "Just Snap" to the market with risk being minimised and giving it great potential for return on investment.

By leveraging our team's existing expertise, university resources, and the demonstrated  interest in a game combining card and rhythm elements, we believe Bloingo Games represents an attractive investment opportunity.

**6.6 Limitations and Constraints**

1. **Early Store Page:**
    - Create a steam store page as soon as possible, with high quality production grade marketing material
    - Appeal to Steam’s recommendation algorithm by garnering ‘Wishlist’ subscriptions prior to release.
2. **Live playtesting event**:
    - Invite others to play the game in its MVP state 2 weeks prior to release, noting direct feedback on our product.
    - Keep in touch with attendees by providing weekly updates based on community feedback, email and Discord notifications, as well as directing them to our other socials.
    - Focus on building a dedicated player community with a dedicated Discord server, Instagram and TikTok channels.
