# Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan

### Risk Mitigation for Funding Shortfalls

### **Development Risks**

1. **Technical challenges integrating rhythm and card mechanics**
    - **Risk:** High
    - **Actions:** Early prototyping and leveraging development experience to identify and resolve technical issues early.
2. **Limited resources extending development timeline**
    - **Risk:** Moderate
    - **Mitigation:** Clearly defining MVP features, conducting regular scope review meetings, and using a modular design approach to allow for flexible development.
3. **Team time constraints due to academic commitments**
    - **Risk:** High
    - **Mitigation:** Establishing a realistic and clear division of responsibilities aligned with academic calendars to ensure manageable workloads.

### **Market Risks**

1. **Oversaturation of the indie game market**
    - **Risk:** Very High
    - **Mitigation:** Ensuring strong differentiation through a unique genre combination and conducting targeted marketing to specific player demographics and communities.
2. **Negative reception from the core audience**
    - **Risk:** High
    - **Mitigation:** Running an early access period for player feedback, conducting extensive playtesting with target populations, and using an agile development approach to address user concerns.
3. **Limited marketing reach due to budget constraints**
    - **Risk:** High
    - **Mitigation:** Initially focusing on building strong, small communities and then expanding outreach to content creators, university networks, and events once the game establishes a strong reputation.

### **Financial Risks**

1. **Unexpected development costs**
    - **Risk:** High
    - **Mitigation Actions:** Following a phased development approach with a tiered structure to align with available budget. Leveraging university resources to reduce costs. Considering the need for a buffer in case of budget overruns.
2. **Insufficient projected sales**
    - **Risk:** High
    - **Mitigation:** Keeping initial development costs low, using conservative financial projections, and adopting a bootstrapped approach to sustain development.
3. **Failure to reach the Kickstarter funding goal**
    - **Risk:** Medium
    - **Mitigation:** Preparing a tiered development plan that adjusts to different funding levels. Identifying alternative funding sources such as grants, schemes, and charitable organisations.
