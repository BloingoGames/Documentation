# Random shit that spawned in our text

£1,600 to £6,400.

Further to this, outlets for community outreach such as social media posts and online outreach are vital for increasing engagement with the store page ([Big Games Machine, 2025](https://www.biggamesmachine.com/steam-next-fest-marketing-strategies/)).

Posting clips of the game on influential platforms such as TikTok – with its 1.9 billion users ([SEO AI, 2025](https://seo.ai/blog/how-many-users-on-tiktok#:~:text=TikTok%20Key%20Statistics-,TikTok%20has%201%2C925%20billion%20users%20globally%2C%20with%20170%20million%20monthly,with%20billions%20of%20views%20each).) – will promote sales, and the creation of a Discord server, anchoring our community by providing them with development updates and garnering their input, is a strategy that has been successfully executed by Supergiant Games with *Hades* ([Why Hades was a Success, 2024](https://benjaminglover.substack.com/p/why-hades-was-a-success)). Additionally, building partnerships with influencers, particularly those that specialise in roguelike deckbuilder and rhythm genres, will accelerate exposure ([Mega Cat Studios, 2024](https://megacatstudios.com/blogs/game-development/mastering-influencer-marketing-game-developers-guide?srsltid=AfmBOoqiw6bLw1IRR79j1ZyI5X_zwvM1ETf9gqCKxOlHk8BnrsNDyKKg)).

In addition to these online strategies, generating word-of-mouth buzz at in-person events is vital for a game’s public awareness on release (REFERENCE). Our team will attend fairs at the University of Bath, including [the monthly Bath Video Game Society LAN sessions](https://www.thesubath.com/bvgs/). Indie games meetups in Bristol, including the [Bristol Indie Developers](https://www.meetup.com/bristol-indie-developers/) sessions, and larger conventions in London such as EGX (REFERENCE) will allow us to build a local following. Furthermore, the [Bristol Games Hub](https://bristol.games/#meetups) will provide easy access to other regular local networking events and communities centred around game development, such as the [BGH Antisocial Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bristolgameshub/).

Using this local following, it will be possible to host in-person play testing events pre-release, allowing for the collection of customer feedback and evaluation of our core gaming mechanics. (*should expand on this probably)*

**3.3 Funding Strategy**

Our team will be using a combination of crowdfunding, grants and personal investments to finance the project beyond development. With marketing being our most significant variable expense, financial surplus can be directed towards maximising publicity and outreach. Once the product is ready, additional income will translate directly into scaling sales.

**Sources of Funding:**

---

| **Crowdfunding** |  |
| --- | --- |

| Kickstarter |  |
| --- | --- |

| 4,000 |  |
| --- | --- |

A platform which has successfully crowdfunded countless other indie video games of similar scope. Our analysis of other projects on the platform suggests that this is a reasonable target figure.

---

---

| **Grants** | University Grants | 5,000 | A winning pitch to the Bath Enterprise entrepreneurship program would secure a £5,000 investment. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |

|  | Transfuzer Grants | 7,500 | Transfuzer offer grants to support prototype development for startup game dev studios. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |

|  | UKGTF Grant | 2,000 | UKGTF Indie Game Development £2,000 grant applications open soon. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |

|  | UK Games Fund | 5,000 | Grant applications open from June. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Whilst grant applications are low effort, they also have low chance of success due to the large number of competitors. Kickstarter on the other hand allows us to leverage the undersupplied niche we are targeting with our game, drawing on the power of community and loyalty to generate funding. As a result, we treat our Kickstarter campaign as our primary and most likely source of external funding.

**Kickstarter Breakdown**

Many such projects are successful (examples?), and there are notable examples of runaway hits on the indie market, such as [Hollow Knight](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight), that demonstrate the potential for community-backed funding. In fact, [most successful game Kickstarter campaigns aim for under $10,000](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats).

Our Kickstarter funding target is: £4,000.

**3.4 Cost Analysis and Revenue Strategy**

**Pricing Model**

Analysing game pricing for games similar in scope, style and quality we found the most popular price to be between £8 and £9.

Steam’s automatic price conversion for games priced at $9.99 is explained [here](https://steamdb.info/blog/valve-price-matrix-2022-update/). Using this information we arrived at the price points shown in the table below.

---

| **Revenue Breakdown** |  |
| --- | --- |

| **Value (UK)** |  |
| --- | --- |

Value (USA)

---

---

| Price | £7.99 | £9.99 |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

| VAT (20%) | £-1.60 | £-2.00 |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

| Steam Fee (30% after VAT) | £-1.92 | £-2.40 |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

| **Gross Revenue per Sale** | **£4.47** | **£5.59** |
| --- | --- | --- |

Setting the price between **£5–£15**  aligns with industry norms for indie titles with less than 10 hours of content ([GameDev Subreddit, 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/jancdd/what_was_your_indie_game_pricing_strategy/)) with the [average price for indie games](https://howtomarketagame.com/2022/08/17/are-indie-games-too-cheap/) being £5.60 as of 2022.

As our game has been designed for well over 10 hours of replayability in mind, we feel £7.99 is an appropriate price for our product.

**Sales Revenue Projections**

We simulated our first game’s sales curves based on Steam game review graphs available on their store pages. To keep our projections realistic, we hand-picked a selection of 5 games similar in scope, style and theme, and considered three scenarios:

**Conservative scenario:** 2,000 total sales before 2027

**Expected scenario:** 7,000 total sales before 2027

**Optimistic scenario:** 20,000 total sales before 2027

![](https://www.notion.so/image/attachment%3A300d0675-d7a1-4fc6-baad-111b3aef8023%3Aimage.png?table=block&id=1bce9645-24c5-807a-b60f-cdb92296cbb9&spaceId=e03dc5e1-3d90-4d65-92c4-31c5fd44800c&width=1630&userId=19ed872b-594c-8180-9d15-0002497db69b&cache=v2)

Cumulative revenue from first game’s sale projections based on USD reference price of $9.99.

After a discussion within the team, we found that on average, members valued their labour at a rate of $60 per hour. After taking into account how much of this amount we would be happy to treat as investments into the company, and the value we retain from ownership of the company itself, we arrived at the conclusion that generating revenue surpassing $10 per hour from our first game could be treated as a success.

We used this rate together with an assumed average of 11 hours of work per member per week to create the reference revenue threshold on the graph above. All revenue earned above this threshold will be treated as profit that will be used for reinvestment back into the company and its projects.

**Total Estimated Development Cost**

After reviewing the minimum and maximum potential expenses outlined, we anticipate spending £2,000 overall. This figure assumes in-house asset production, a lean marketing campaign, basic legal registration, and mitigated server costs. Developer salaries are not included. If additional grants are obtained or our Kickstarter targets exceeded, further funds will be put towards marketing to maximise growth.

Our ROI calculations also assume £2,000 as the baseline.

**Return on Investment Projections, by 2027**

Based on comparable indie game performance metrics and our conservative sales estimates:

|  |  |  |  |  |

| Optimistic | 20,000 | £89,400 | £87,400 | 4,370% |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

These projections account for Steam's 30% platform fee and £7.99 price point, but for simplicity assume no additional marketing expenditure beyond initial budget or further revenue streams such as DLC release.

**6.4 Financial Documentation - *I think this will go in 3.3***

s a financially sound approach for bringing "Just Snap" to the market with risk being minimised and giving it great potential for return on investment

This funding strategy presents a financially sound approach for bringing "Just Snap" to the market with risk being minimised and giving it great potential for return on investment.

By leveraging our team's existing expertise, university resources, and the demonstrated  interest in a game combining card and rhythm elements, we believe Bloingo Games represents an attractive investment opportunity.

**6.6 Limitations and Constraints**

**Early Store Page:**

Create a steam store page as soon as possible, with high quality production grade marketing material

Appeal to Steam’s recommendation algorithm by garnering ‘Wishlist’ subscriptions prior to release.

**Live playtesting event**:

Invite others to play the game in its MVP state 2 weeks prior to release, noting direct feedback on our product.

Keep in touch with attendees by providing weekly updates based on community feedback, email and Discord notifications, as well as directing them to our other socials.

Focus on building a dedicated player community with a dedicated Discord server, Instagram and TikTok channels.

An alternative with nostalgia:

Just Snap is an innovative new game that fuses the strategic nature of card games with a fast-paced multiplayer challenge driven by musical rhythm mechanics. With a classic flair that taps into the player's fond memories of old-school games, Just Snap delivers a fresh yet nostalgic experience that’s both satisfying and addictive.

Would get rid of the reference to “roguelike” because non-gamers will not be familiar. And the intro should probably not introduce unfamiliar terminology if it can be avoided.

i think defining roguelike here makes more sense than never saying it

we should explain what rogue-like means somewhere

a reference for this would be convincing

[https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/toys-hobby/toys-games/card-games/united-kingdom](https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/toys-hobby/toys-games/card-games/united-kingdom)

I would link this

find from our minutes

A word on the success of tabletop and trad cards seems missing here, and we have the research ready

make more specific about Just Snap instead of generic bloingo

some things we can fill in based on rubbish (pretty?) games

Andy’s feedback didn’t really give us a direction to go towards, probably my bad lol

Hope it sounds CONVINCING

Another option is to just introduce the graph explicitly in the flow of the previous paragraph. That way we’re not interfering with the subheading structure of this section for a single. *(so like maybe the title could be optional idk?)*

I don't think the graphs are bloat tbf. They're a key source of information on why we've chosen what we have. Could you put the other graphs in the appendices? Or with the other points?

how many exactly?

This still needs fleshing out/debloingo-ing

(link here?)

[This is the link Francis wanted to keep note of]

Feel free to trim the bloin, hopefully it includes all the points needed in the mark scheme?

we just threw it in here quickly to remind francis to write it, company after team was my immediate thought but if it works better somewhere else that’s great

does companies house provide IP protection too Rob?

I’ve cut some stuff here that amounted to “we will obey the law”

Need more of a strategy/chronology/timeline

We could just cut this? It pads things out a little, but it’s not really *local.*

Francis’ comment: should we have revenue here?

paraphrased ofc

Are they the same as the 5 games mentioned before? In Competitor analysis?

these ones

Are these the numbers we’ve decided? I’m basing ROI calculations on them

lets go with yes. They’re pretty realistic. I can give an explanation of where they come from over a call if interested.

TODO: Need to make these more realistic.

This section is kinda crucial but comes out of nowehere. Maybe make heading bigger?

where do these numbers come from? Do they taking into account the assumed $10 / hr thing from the revenue section?

Could be shortened

Swapped them out because i think this looks infinitely cleaner.

important

Distinct from financial risks?
